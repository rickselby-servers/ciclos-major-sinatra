        <p>As Kalas' brand ambassador for the Balearic Islands we are ideally placed to assist them in product testing
          and development, as well as general promotion of this premier cycle and sports clothing brand.</p>
        <p>Riding 300-500 miles a week, week in, week out means our Guides need to be comfortable and well equipped in
          durable clothing as well as presenting our professional image to both existing and prospective clients. The
          premium quality Kalas clothing keeps them healthy and relaxed whilst giving them identity and style. As all
          our regular clients also get to experience the Kalas 'touch' when they ride in their complimentary Ciclos
          Major jersey on 'Jersey Day' and hopefully many other days as well!</p>

          Our chosen partner for accommodation on the Island, built through experience and satisfaction over the last
          ten years. Ciclos Major is now working closer than ever with the Zafiro group as their leading contact in the
          UK, and for the US and Canada. Although we have previously been centred on the Zafiro Tropic hotel in Alcudia,
          the addition of the 5* Zafiro Palace, also in Alcudia and the boutique Hotel ‘Can Ribera’ in Muro to our
          portfolio means we are uniquely placed to meet any requirement and indeed, expectation.

          Our nutrition partner for the past two seasons we're in good company as Secret Training also provide all
          sports nutrition for the Yates brothers and the whole of the Mitchelton-SCOTT World Tour Professional team.
          With the creation of Ciclos Major we have cemented our relationship with this valued partner and we are now in
          a position to provide all your sports nutrition needs for your stay, meaning you don’t have to lug weighty
          powders and gels to the island, plus you get to be involved in product testing and development as well as
          getting a chance to try exciting new products such as their unique Juice Bars and Protein Energy Gels! We plan
          to get Secret Training's owner and brand inspirator Tim Lawson over to the island on occasion to present his
          products and the science behind them, in return he gets some direct customer feedback!
