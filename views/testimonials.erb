<h4>Peter Linstead – Infinity Cycles March 2022:</h4>
<p>Fantastic staff, great organisation, excellent routes, based in a great location. We have no negatives about this
  company only positive feedback. It was the fifth time both myself and Gail have visited the island and this was the
  first time we have done an organised cycling holiday. It won’t be the last. We will definitely be holidaying with
  yourselves again in the near future. Keep up the good work. Happy miles with lots of smiles.</p>

<h4>Collette Leslie – Lee Valley Youth C.C. February 2022:</h4>

<p>Such a great training camp/holiday😂 make sure to show off the tan on the Essex lanes</p>

<h4>Alessandro Sella – Lee Valley Youth C.C. February 2022:</h4>
<p>Thanks for such a lovely trip! Had so much fun and it was run without a real hitch as always!</p>

<h4>Andrew Reid – Chelmer C.C. October 2021:</h4>
<p>I cannot recommend Ciclos Major enough – Antony knows Mallorca like the back of his hand; the routes, the café stops,
  the bars / restaurants, but crucially is an exceptional “captain” getting the group really working together / for each
  other, always positive in his feedback and giving confidence to push yourself during the day ….. with the knowledge
  that he’ll get you home safe and happy! Ciclos Major did absolutely all the organising, which for me included renting
  a bike and dealing with any mechanicals.</p>

<h4>Jonny Kempster – North Essex Velo October 2021:</h4>
<p>The end of a fantastic 10 days in Mallorca with the CM crew. The management of our trip has been amazing from start
  to finish, I cannot recommended enough. Rode with some amazing people who I can now call friends. I can’t wait to come
  back next year.</p>

<h4>Jax Castle – V.C. Norwich October 2021:</h4>
<p>Landed to 🌞. Had a fab time thanks for everything. Now counting down 52 weeks until next year.</p>

<h4>Sara Lees – North Essex Velo October 2021:</h4>

  time off work for 2022 – Fingers crossed. 🤞🚴‍♀️🚴‍♂️☀️.</p>

<h4>John Golder – Chelmer C.C. October 2021:</h4>

<h4>Duncan Gilbert – Chelmer C.C. October 2021:</h4>

<p>A terrific ride today. Really enjoyed it. Americano here we come 😳, (apparently 🤔).</p>

<h4>Peter Harrison – BCG February 2020:</h4>
<p>Thank you all for an amazing final day. Petra was a great lunch stop. Glad there were not too many climbs today but

<h4>Tony Meader – February 2020:</h4>
<p>Just wanted to say a big thank you to Ciclos Major: Darryl Leese, Liz Rooney, Antony Stapleton, Andrew Yeoman for all
  their energy, smiling faces, and “can do” attitude … Despite some bumps along the way, I had a fabulous 10 days and I
  will try and get back as soon as I can.</p>

<h4>Bruce Mackie – LVYCC – February 2020:</h4>
